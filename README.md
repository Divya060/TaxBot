The TaxBot is an AI powered chatbot that helps an user summarize important financial tax related documents and also answer questions based on Indian Tax Laws and also questions based on the document uploaded.
The main motivation behind this project is to help users in filing their taxes more comfortably with the help of AI.
This project introduces an AI-powered, downloadable software solution that runs locally on the user's system, ensuring complete privacy while automating tax document analysis and providing personalized guidance.
By integrating advanced natural language processing (NLP) models, such as BART for summarization and RoBERTa for question-answering, the system simplifies the tax filing process and enhances understanding of Indian tax laws.
This project uses two Large Language Models namely Bart for document summarization and and RoBerta for Question answering.
The TaxBot is available as an exe file, packaged together using pyinstaller, that can be downloaded from a simple webpage. 
The exe file is hosted in this repository itself.
Note:
The files related to pyinstaller have not been added to the repository.
